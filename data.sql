('10 Degrees', 'Urban Roots Brewing','Czech Style Lager',5.99,3.9, 'Czech Style served in a Czech style beer glass and from a traditional “side pull” tap handle for a truly authentic experience. This beer is brewed with 100% Czech grown Saaz hops and floor malted Bohemian Pilsner malt made just outside of Prague (thanks to Weyermann Specialty Malts) which lends it plenty of richness and complexity with a classic hop flavor and aroma'),
('Righteo', 'Original Pattern', 'Hazy Pale Ale', 6.49, 5.6, 'NZ Rakau, NZ Moutere, and Mosaic hops create flavorful notes of apricot, grapefruit, and pine that pair beautifully with a medium, pillowy body, and low-to-no hop bitterness.'),
('Orval', 'Brasserie d`Orval', 'Trappist Ale', 8.00, 6.9,' Orval is brewed unfiltered by Catholic monks at a monastery founded in the 1100s in the pastoral Belgium countryside. Three different malts and two types of hops, & Brettanomyces yeast, impart a great character and complexity.');
