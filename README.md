**CAPSTONE PROJECT 1: _Provisions_ Online Storefront**


**_Provisions_** is an online platform providing users access to a highly currated selection of craft beer, natural wine, N/A beverages, and specialty food items. 

Whether it's a family dinner, a friend's birthday party, or a date night with a special someone, **_Provisions_** will have the treats to make any occasion special


**Standard User Flow**
Users will be greeted by an accesible homepage. Users will sign up to have access to the shopping cart functionality. If a user decides to not sign up, they can still see whats available in the store, but won't be able to add anything to the cart. 

After a user signs up or signs in they are directed to their account page with their information and from there they can begin adding items to the cart.
